A fractal curve but rendered in 3D
------

```
bower install # install Three.js
node-dev # watch and compile CoffeeScript, etc.
```

`build/index.html` is the entry of this project.

This is the code of my paper, I was trying to draw dractals in 3D space.  
Here I'm using Quaternion to calculate the positions.  
For the rendering part, I use Three.js to accomplish.
